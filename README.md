**Tipster** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Deep Patel (DGh0st)**

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators. (only the locale-specific currency)
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Settings page to change the default people count and change the values for the tips (5%-30%) and people count (1-15).

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I did not have many challenges as I had already been exposed to iOS slightly with the modifications I had made for iOS Jailbreak Community. Swift was fun to learn and very different from Objective-C, which was a bit challenging at first to get used to.
